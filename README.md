# Content: D3.js
## Project: University Attendence Data

## Project Overview
In this project, we will use D3.js for interactive visualisations. Next, you will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the JSON data into a workable format. Afterwards, you will use workable data to create a different set of graphs to represent the data. 


## Project Highlights
This project is designed to understand & identify the hidden insights in attendance data for overall courses available in university. Using MicroView & MacroView visualisations, represented data has shown some useful information to conclude the average attendance rate maintained by different age categories.


## Software used:
